## Music Debate between Eddie and I
Technology used: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Statsmodel

## Overview
My roommate, Eddie, and I seem to argue a lot about random ideas. One day we somehow got into a debate about the correlation between monthly listeners on Spotify and how "good" an artist is. We both agreed that just because an artist has more monthly listeners, it does not make them better than the other. But, Eddie seemed to disagree that his favorite artists have more monthly listeners than others. I believed that there is a strong correlation between the two, so we decided to take a sample of popular rap artists and have Eddie rate each artist on how "good" they are. We compiled a data set with the artist's name, monthly listeners on Spotify, and Eddie's ranking.  

## Insights
I was able to use my knowledge of regression from my Econometrics class to apply it to our own data set that we created. I regressed Rank on Monthly Listener and created a scatter plot to easily visulize the data. The even printed the correlation variable between them to represent the positive correlation. I then went online to learn how to create a line of best fit using numpy. This line of best fit was the hardest aspect to argue against.
